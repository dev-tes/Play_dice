## What I Did

- Used Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
- Used Flutter stateful widgets to update the user interface.
- Changed the properties of various widgets.
- Used onPressed listeners to detect when buttons are pressed.
- Used setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.
- Used Expanded to make widgets adapt to screen dimensions.
- Coded and used gesture controls.
